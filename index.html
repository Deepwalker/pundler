# Pundler

The virtualenv alternative for python developer

---

# Past

- You have to create venv for every project and for every python interpreter version
- With PIP you cannot be sure that your will get some packages versions when you call `pip install` (pip-tools?)
  in case you have not write versions, dependencies with versions exactly and using --no-deps (you must).

---

# Working with branches

- You are working on branch where you have changed packages version with breaking changes in API.
- When you are in situation to fix something in other branch you will need to change virtualenv.
- And when work done you need to change it again.

Not so with Pundler.

---

# Meet Pundler

It solves freezed mess
- reads your requirements.txt
- creates freezed.txt with exact installed versions of your requirements and their dependencies
- keeps all packages installed and share them between projects
- loads desired versions of packages

You will always work with package version that freezed.txt points to.

---

# Do not install every time

Punder keeps packages per user and python version.
Something like `~/.pundledir/CPython-3.4.1-default` or `~/.pundledir/PyPy-2.3.1-32f35069a16d/`

Pundler installs every package in isolated dir like `django-1.7.1` or `flask-0.10.1`, so it can
keep multiple packages versions installed and select required versions on load.

---

# Activate vs Fixate

- `. venv/bin/activate`?
- than we need explicitly to deactivate
- dont forget it when cd to other project
- dont forget to change `venv` when change branch with breaking changes

---

# usercostumize.py

Pundler uses `usercostumize.py` file to provide automatic way to load your packages.

This file is special for every python interpreter version, so you need to `fixate` pundler
once for each one.

Seems like implicit usage, but do you type all paths by hand or use autocomplete feature of your shell?
Relax and use it - its part of your development environment and we does not suggest to use it on production servers
where deploy tools will take care of automagic for you.

# Right way to deploy docker container

- pundler freeze target_dir

  - install git or download pundler from github and unpack
  - install python (strongly recommended)
  - `cd; git clone --recursive https://github.com/Deepwalker/pundler.git; python ~/pundler/pundler.py fixate` 
  - `cd project_dir`
  - `python -m pundler upgrade` # will create freezed.txt and install all packages
  - `python manage.py run`
